*(From Whatsapp)*
>>>>JUST LISTEN.  
*Loving you in ways I can. Iâ€™m also having separation anxiety from missing you all. ðŸ˜•*
**Itâ€™s still hard for me to believe that I hurt you so badly that you donâ€™t need or want me in your lives. *
Smh! I regret whatever I did or didnâ€™t do as your mother. Iâ€™m struggling to know or understand just what it is? **YOU KNOW THAT I AM DYING INSIDE SOME DAYS DO TO THIS PAIN.**  But Iâ€™ll live until my time comes, as all of us. But this family is wasting valuable time. Da can careless, either way he feels like a winner! Smh 
Chris, Aaron and Matthew you all have the wrong idea.*

I understand that addiction to food is not a good thing when it effects
your health and everyday life. What I do not understand quite much is 
how this connects to me and what I am saying to you about the things
I am looking to do. I am not sure which way to move in life all I
see is what I see. If you wish for me to see something
else then we have to try and communicate it more effectively.
